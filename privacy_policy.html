    <ul> 
        <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you. </li>
        <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
        <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time.</p>


    <h3><b>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</b></h3>
    <p> We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
    
    <h3><b>Third-party marketing</b></h3>
    <p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the group of companies for marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h3><b>Opting out</b></h3>
    <p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting our Data Privacy Manager.
    </p>

    <h3><b>Change of purpose</b></h3>
    <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
    </p>

    <h2><b>5. Disclosures of your personal data</b></h2>
    <h3><b>International transfers</b></h3>
    <p> We may share your personal data with the following third parties based outside of the EEA: service providers acting as processors who provide IT and system administration services.
    </p>
    
    <h3><b>Data security</b></h3>
    <p> We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
    </p>
    
    <h3><b>Data retention</b></h3>
    <p>
        How long will you use my personal data for? We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
    </p>
    
    <h2><b>6. Your legal rights</b></h2>
    <p>
       Under data protection laws, in certain circumstances, you have the right to: 
    </p>
    
    <ul> 
        <li>Request access to your personal data (known as a “data subject access request”). enabling you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
        <li>Request correction of any incomplete or inaccurate personal data that we hold about you. We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
        <li>Request erasure of your personal data. You may ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing, where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
        <li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
        <li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. You may ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
        <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> 
        If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our Data Privacy Manager. <br>
        If you are unhappy with the way in which your personal data has been processed you, have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance using the contact details above so that your concerns may be dealt with via our internal complaints procedure.
    </p>



    <h2><b>No fee usually required</b></h2>
    <p> 
        You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your legal rights). We may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Time limit to respond</b></h2>
    <p>
        We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
    </p>
